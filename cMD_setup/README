Preparation scripts for MD simulations of polypeptides and proteins.
Author: Jamie Macpherson

Description:
A collection of scripts which will enable the user to prepare a .pdb file for simulation using Gromacs.
In addition to Bash scripts I have also included a series of Gromacs parameter files (.mdp) which contain
basic parameters for a four-step equilibration in the NVT and NPT ensembles (for a description of molecular
dynamics in various ensembles refer to the following file: chapt1_theory.pdf). 

1. Solvation of .pdb file (00_Preparation.sh).
Explicit solvent MD simulation are started by generating a topology file for the polypeptide and solvating the
starting structure in a bath of explicit water. Note that if you have a protein + ligand system that you would
like to simulate, the ligand topology must be generated separately.

Use:
./00_Preparation.sh <molname>


2. Ionization of the water bath (01_Ions.sh).
The system charge may need to be neutralized or the user may want to add a given concentration of ions to the
solution.

Use:
./01_Ions.sh <molname> <n_pos_ions> <n_neg_ions> #number of positive & negative ions to add


3. Generate positional restraint files (03_Add_POSRES.sh).
.itp files are generated including parameters which invoke a harmonic restraint potential on protein atoms with
force constants 1000, 4000, 5000 and 10000 kJ/mol/nm^2.

Use:
./03_Add_POSRES.sh <molname> <counterion name>


4. Minimization of the system (04_Minimization.sh).
5000 steps of steepest descent are used to minimize the system.

Use: ./04_Minimization.sh <molname>


5. NVT equilibration followed by NPT equilibration.
Following energy minimization with 5000 steps of steepest descent, harmonic positional restriants with a force con-
stant of 10000 kJ=mol=nm2 are imposed onto the protein heavy atoms and gradually reduced to 1000 kJ=mol=nm2 while
the temperature was increased from 50 to 300 K at constant volume. During this NVT ensemble equilibration,
the Berendsen algorithm is employed to regulate the temperature and pressure of the system with coupling constants
of 0.2 ps and 0.5 ps, respectively. A 1 ns NVT equilibration run at 300 K and 1 bar is then performed, following 1
ns of equilibration in NPT conditions.

Use: ./05_Equilibration_NVT.sh <molname>

     ./05_Equilibration_NPT.sh <molname>


6. Production run (under NPT ensemble conditions).
Temperature is regulated using the V-rescaling algorithm, with a coupling constant of 0.1. All protein covalent
bonds are frozen with the LINCS method, while SETTLE is used for water molecules. Electrostatic interactions
are calculated with the particle mesh Ewald method, with a 1.4 nm cutoff for direct space sums, a 0.12 nm FFT grid
spacing and a four-order interpolation polynomial for the reciprocal space sums. Van der Walls interactions are
measured using a 1.4 nm cutoff. The neighbour list for non-covalent interactions is updated every five integration steps.
