The local King's network has restricted access from the outside through
a firewall which you can by-pass using the port '-p51515'. However,
because the MOE license server is hosted on Ribosome it is not possible
to access from outside of the local network.

Procedure for running MOE off-campus:
1. SSH to mito, forwarding the X-terminal
ssh -p51515 -X usersame@159.52.55.65

2. Run mito
/apps/moe2015/bin-lnx64/moe
